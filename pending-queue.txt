Help me make a project named "cool-prolog" with HTML, CSS, JS front-end (that we shall serve using serve -s command) and backend will be nodejs based. Do not generate any code untill I say.

(do not gen)

<------------------------------------------------------->

Following is my directory structure:

project/
  backend/
  frontend/

we have to create a nodejs project in backend/ directory with following structure

backend/
  src/
    controllers/
      PrologController.js
    routes/
      api.js
    app.js
  node_modules/
  package.json

tell me 'npm' and 'mkdir' commands to create directory structure and install dependencies.
Also add cors and Controller functionality. Use 'tau-prolog' to execute prolog queries in controller. Make sure to add following two routes:

- /sync : to sync connection and make sure everything is working right. This method should return success true in json
- /exec : executes a string given in request . string may have many prolog rules, or queries. and it should return result string with all the outputs . if there are many outputs, use '\n' between them

<------------------------------------------------------->

Now let us work on html, css and js. We shall not call api yet, let us just focus on making design first.
In pasted screenshot, there is an exmaple of jupyter notebook with python code.
In our html, css, js design, I do not want to write python. But i want to write Prolog there.
We do not need any colors for that as well, however a good console type of font will be great that we can add from google fonts.

With each cell, there should be a div below for results. And on left side of cell, add 'run' and 'delete' icons. There should always be a 'Create' button in center when pressed it adds a new cell and focus on input.

I have created a directory frontend/ follow following directory structure:

frontend/
  assets/
    css/
      global.css  # for global styling. like body, color theme in :root variables, etc
      fonts.css   # to import fonts
      cool-prolog.css # for cells styling
    js/
      cool-prolog.js
  index.html

Give me mkdir and touch commands to create directories and files.
